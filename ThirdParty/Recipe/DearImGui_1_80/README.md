# Dear ImGui

Recipe for building: [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
As the library does not come with a official build solution we have our own cmake based one.

Beware [Dear ImGui is designed and optimized to create debug tools](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#q-can-you-reskin-the-look-of-dear-imgui)
