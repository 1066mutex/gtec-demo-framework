# glm.Core

OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) is a header only C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications.

For more information see the [official repository](https://github.com/g-truc/glm).

This is the default configuration which is configured for OpenGL compatibility.

So GLM_FORCE_DEPTH_ZERO_TO_ONE is **NOT** defined
