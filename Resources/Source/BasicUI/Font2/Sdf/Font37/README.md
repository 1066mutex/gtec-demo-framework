# Notes

SDF bitmap font [Hiero](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Hiero) a SDF example is present [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Distance-field-fonts).

The generated font was then tweaked with the kerning and xAdvance data from the normal Font48 since the two tools generate very different kerning information.
