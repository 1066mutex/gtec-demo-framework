Android:
--------
- Android does not handle unicode file names inside the 'assets' folder, 
  so do not utilize unicode for filenames stored in Content.


Windows:
--------
- The generated project files do not detect changes to the build environment automatically.
  So its your job to run FslBuildGen when you change it!
- If a new shader is added to Content.bld and no files has been modified the content builder
  does not get run by visual studio.
