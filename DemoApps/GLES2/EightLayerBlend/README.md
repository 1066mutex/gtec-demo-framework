## EightLayerBlend
<img src="./Example.jpg" height="96px" align="right">

Do a simple parallax scrolling effect by blending eight layers on top of each other.
This is not the most optimal way to do it as it uses eight passes. 

The demo was created to compare GLES to the G2D eight blend blit functionality.
