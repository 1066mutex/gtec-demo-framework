## G2D

### [DFGraphicsBasic2D](DFGraphicsBasic2D)

Shows how to use the Demo Frameworks 'basic' 2d rendering capabilities that work across all backends.
The basic2D interface allows you to render ASCII strings using a system provided font and draw colored points.

The functionality in Basic2D is used internally in the framework to render the profiling overlays like the frame rate counter and graph.

### [EightLayers](EightLayers)

Shows how to use the G2D API blit functions to create a multiplane/multilayer landscape.
The layers are rendered to the FB directly without having the need of using other APIs.
