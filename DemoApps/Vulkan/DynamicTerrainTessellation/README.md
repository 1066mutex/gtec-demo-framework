## Dynamic terrain tessellation (Tessellation shader)
<img src="./Example.jpg" height="96px" align="right">

Renders a terrain with dynamic tessellation based on screen space triangle size, resulting in closer parts of the terrain getting more details than distant parts. The terrain geometry is also generated by the tessellation shader using a 16 bit height map for displacement. To improve performance the example also does frustum culling in the tessellation shader.
